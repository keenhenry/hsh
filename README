[Program Details]:
Hank shell allows maximum of 256 arguments on the command line.

Below lists all the builtin commands implemented in Hank Shell:

cd	 : change current working directory to home directory
dirs     :
kill     : 
exit	 : terminate exeucution of sh
echo     :
history  : show command histor
pwd      :
pushd    :
popd     :
path     :

pushd [dir] : change current working directory to [dir] and push previous working directory on
to stack (shell internal datastructure).

popd : does the opposite of pushd, taking no arguments. If more arguments are specified on the
command line, sh will complain and display a new prompt.

path : show sh search directory list.
path [+|-] [dir] : add or delete directory from direcotory list. The list is managed by an
shell internal environmental variable.

Hank Shell path variable and directory stack are both implemented with doubly linked list (in stack.c
and stack.h).
