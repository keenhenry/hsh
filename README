Below lists all (9) the builtin commands implemented in Hank Shell:

cd	 : change current working directory
dirs     : list pushed directories on the directory stack
exit	 : terminate exeucution of sh
echo     : echo strings that follow this command
history  : show commands history
pwd      : print current working directory
pushd    : push directory onto a directory stack
popd     : pop directory from directory stack
path     : list command search paths in command paths list and add/remove path(s) from that list
	   
pushd [dir] : change current working directory to [dir] and push previous working directory on
to stack (shell internal datastructure).

popd : 

path : show sh search directory list.
path [+|-] [dir] : add or delete directory from direcotory list. The list is managed by an
shell internal environmental variable.

Hank Shell path variable and directory stack are both implemented with doubly linked list (in stack.c
and stack.h).
